#Description

Learn [cl-cairo2](https://github.com/rpav/cl-cairo2) with koans. These koans are language learning exercises made from broken unit tests that guide the learner progressively through many cl-cairo2 features. 

#Getting Started

From a terminal, execute your lisp interpreter on the file 'contemplate.lsp' e.g.

sbcl --script contemplate.lsp

#Quoting the Ruby Koans instructions::

"In test-driven development the mantra has always been, red, green, refactor. Write a failing test and run it (red), make the test pass (green), then refactor it (that is look at the code and see if you can make it any better). In this case you will need to run the koan and see it fail (red), make the test pass (green), then take a moment and reflect upon the test to see what it is teaching you and improve the code to better communicate its intent (refactor)."

#Content

cl-cairo2-koans are based on [The Common Lisp koans](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans) by google.
